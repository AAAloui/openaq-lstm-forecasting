# ðŸ§¼ ETL â€“ Data Ingestion & Processing

This folder contains scripts to:
- Ingest historical and live air quality data from OpenAQ
- Clean and standardize datasets
- Store data in CSV, Parquet, or cloud storage (Azure, S3, etc.)

## Scripts To Be Added

- `fetch_openaq_live.py`
- `fetch_openaq_historical.py`
- `preprocess_data.py`

## Future Ideas

- Integrate with Kafka/EventHub for streaming
- Use Airflow or ADF for orchestration

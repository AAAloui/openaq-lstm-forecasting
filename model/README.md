# ðŸ§  Model â€“ Training & Retraining

This directory houses scripts and modules to:
- Train LSTM models for PM2.5 prediction
- Evaluate and log metrics
- Save and load models (e.g., using MLflow or joblib)

## Scripts To Be Added

- `train_model.py`
- `evaluate_model.py`
- `retrain_pipeline.py`

## Model Architecture

- LSTM-based sequence model
- Input: Time series of PM2.5 and weather features
- Output: Forecast for the next hour

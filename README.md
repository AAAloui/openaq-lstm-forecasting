# 🌍 Air Quality Forecasting Pipeline

This project is a real-time and batch-processing pipeline to predict air pollution (PM2.5) using OpenAQ data and an LSTM-based AI model. It includes:

- 🔄 Data ingestion from OpenAQ (real-time and historical)
- 🧠 Model training and retraining using deep learning (LSTM)
- 🚀 Real-time inference API for predictions
- 📊 Dashboards for visualizing live and historical air quality
- ⚙️ CI/CD for model deployment and data pipeline automation

## 📁 Project Structure

- `etl/` – Scripts for extracting, cleaning, and transforming data from OpenAQ
- `model/` – Training, evaluating, and saving the LSTM model
- `inference/` – API service for real-time air quality predictions
- `dashboard/` – Power BI / Grafana dashboards and configs
- `data/` – Local datasets and processed outputs
- `docker/` – Dockerfiles and deployment configurations
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experiments and development

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, PySpark, TensorFlow/Keras
- FastAPI, Docker, Azure (or AWS/GCP)
- OpenAQ API, MLflow, Power BI / Grafana

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
